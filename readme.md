# Green-Github

## Usage

- fork this Repo and clone it to the scr you want it to exist in.
- make sure the cloned folder is linked to your account and its configured as well.
- run either the .py file (if installed on your machine) or .js file.
- Enjoy green Github profile flexing (just don't forget to run this everyday huh? ;D)

## About

- Automated script to spam your git repo with (runtimes \* 2) commits, in order for the profile contributions to become greener.

## TBD

- Add a microservice to automate this at fixed intervals or times a-day on the particular machine this is cloned on.
